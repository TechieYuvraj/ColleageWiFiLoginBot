Setting a different browser as the default browser should not affect the code's ability to connect to the WiFi network. The code operates independently of the browser.

If the code is consistently showing as connected but not actually connecting, it suggests that there might be additional requirements or security measures in place that the code is not handling correctly.

Here are a few more suggestions to troubleshoot the issue:

1. Inspect the network traffic: Capture the network traffic using a tool like Wireshark or browser developer tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools) while manually connecting to the WiFi network. Analyze the requests and responses to identify any additional headers, cookies, or parameters that are being sent during the authentication process. Make sure your code includes those elements when making the requests.

2. Check for JavaScript-based authentication: Some WiFi login systems may rely on JavaScript-based authentication mechanisms. In such cases, making requests using urllib alone may not be sufficient. Consider using a more advanced library like Selenium, which can automate browser interaction and execute JavaScript code. Selenium can simulate a more realistic browser-like experience.

3. Verify the correctness of form data: Double-check that the field names and values being sent in the POST request match the requirements of the WiFi login system. Inspect the HTML form on the login page to ensure your code is sending the correct data.

4. Additional security measures: Some WiFi login systems employ additional security measures like Captchas, one-time passwords, or two-factor authentication. If these measures are in place, your code needs to handle them accordingly. Check if any such measures are present and adjust the code accordingly.

If the issue persists, it might be helpful to reach out to your college's IT support for specific details about their WiFi network and any special requirements for authentication.

I apologize for the inconvenience, and I hope these suggestions help in resolving the issue.
